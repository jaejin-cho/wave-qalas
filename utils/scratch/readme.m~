% script_qalas_mapping.m : uses an R=2-fold accelerated 3d-qalas
% acquisition at 1.15 mm iso resolution as well as an lower resolution
% 3d-AFI b1 mapping sequence for T1, T2, PD (and inversion efficiency)
% mapping. data are from a healthy volunteer.
%
% the script expects names of the nifti (and json files to read parameters)
% data obtained by converting the dicoms from the scanner using e.g.
% dcm2niix
% the script also assumes that FSL is in the path and uses BET, FLIRT and
% ROBUSTFOV functions
% the example data are in vivo, thus BET is used to accelerate the mapping
% to eliminate non-brain tissue. for phantom experiments, the BET
% functionality will need to be bypassed.
